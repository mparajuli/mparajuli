I am a passionate learner and a practical devotee in life. I am always eager to learn something new and apply them in a real-life situation. I think it is very important in the Computer Science field because things are evolving daily, and we have to keep ourselves updated with the new technology and platforms. I like to face challenges and take them as a learning opportunity.
